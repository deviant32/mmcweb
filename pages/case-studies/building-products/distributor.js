      solution="Through our data hygiene process, we clean up the customer data and take the underserved customers at a distribution level executed through multi-touch, multichannel marketing campaigns via inside sales, direct mail, email, and fulfillment methods. This allows MMC to handle the full range of customer communications
      by capturing additional account data during each interaction and nurturing those opportunities to close sales and analyze lost sales. Using the marketing co-op funds, MMC ran an actual program that can be tracked and deliver results, giving the distributor their own local brand experience, while growing national revenue for the manufacturer. This gives the manufacturer a level of control for their marketing efforts and ensures brand communications."
